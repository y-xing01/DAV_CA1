# Data Analysis Visualization - Diamond Dataset
Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a diamond dataset. The dataset includes information on nearly 54,000 diamonds, including attributes such as price, carat, cut, color, clarity, dimensions, depth, and table. The objective of the analysis is to gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset and understand the relationships between different attributes.
